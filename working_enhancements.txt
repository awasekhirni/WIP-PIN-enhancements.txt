# Social Network and Graph Enhancements 
1. Graph Relationship Types - expand the relationship types beyond basic connections 
2. relationship strength algorithms - expand on metrics to configure algorithms for computing relationship strength, correlations 
3. social influence scoring - store and calculate social influence metrics 
4. network centrality metrics - identify key parameters, metrics to compute network centrality
5. community detection results and metrics - build community detection algorithms
6. Interest graph - lets build and model user interests as a graph tie it with each user profile 
7. expertise graph storage - we can extend this to map with current expertise, anticipated/goals for user profile, learning goals. this approach may help students enhance their skills yoy.
8. recommendations - devise recommendations graphs , tag them autonomous (ML model generated), user preference based, peer recommendation based, model it based on degrees of freedom ( no of independent pieces of information used to compute a statistic variable)
9. trust scoring metrics - track network growth and health metrics based on user defined criteria.
10.multi-dimensional relationship storage - store relationships as graph based json with multiple attributes 
11. Provide transparent insights to users for free, also identify cyber stalker, scammer alert incorporating scammer hunt, various other data to enrich and protect users proactively. 
what else... should we incorporate..?
