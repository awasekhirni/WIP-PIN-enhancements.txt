In an increasingly shared and fractional economy, the systems governing asset ownership and revenue distribution remain struck in the past. From blockbuster film with a dozen of profit participants to a commercial real-estate property with multiple investors, tracking who owns what and ensuring they get paid accurately is a manual, opaque and costly process. These legacy systems create friction, foster distinct, and leave billions in inefficiency on the table. ACORDS is a paradigm-shifting platform that solves this foundation problem. Leveraging the immutable power of blockchain technology, smart contracts and forensic digital identification. ACORDS creates a single, trusted source of truth for any complex asset. We don’t just record ownership; we automate its entire financial lifecycle, ensuring transparency, security and automatic execution for the modern world
